        Nile Gallery was born in 2010 as an idea, concretized in 2014. The idea started in 2009 with the creation of Tazyeen Foundation for Community Development, an initiative aiming at developing certain communities that are underserved in art and culture. After a year and several workshops, the need arose to create an exhibition space that would host professional and superb quality art, and making it accessible to all strata of the community through curated exhibitions and printed documentation of the diversity of practices hosted by this space.

        While confined within a number of white walls and spreading over one hundred and fifty square meters, the gallery's planned role reaches far beyond numeric parameters of this inspiring location** overlooking the Nile, the famed river from which it draws the name and which witnessed over 5000 years of Egypt's vibrant cultural history. Located in Zamalek, a Cairo's district pounding with community particularly receptive to art and culture, Nile Gallery's mission is to display art of exquisite quality for artists who are committed and passionate about their careers. Nile Gallery is a hub engaging with individuals exploring Egyptian creative practices. Nile Gallery aims to become a nucleus in redefining the understanding of the exhibition spaces and the curatorial vocation of its founders and guest curators.
